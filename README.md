SERVER MAIL : 
It is a project that was for my school, it aims to be a server for your emails that allows you to send, read, save, and so on your emails.

Requirements : 
You just have to install cryptography (if you want to have the functionality to encrypt your emails).
- pip install cryptography

Installing : 
You just have to clone the repo, and then executes the .py. 
- git clone https://github.com/samyb99/Server-Mail
- python serverMail.py
and now you can use it.

Utilization :
When you initiate the project, you will be prompted with a menu with the different functions of the project. You just have to choose which of them you want to use.
ATTENTION : When you launch the project, a database is created with some table per default and with some emails already inserted, but you can comments them or modify them if you want.

Acknowledgements :
